You are working on SwiftLint, a linter for Swift code that enforces coding style and conventions. It helps maintain a clean and consistent codebase by identifying and reporting issues in Swift files. It can even automatically fix some of these issues.

Linting rules are defined in `Source/SwiftLintBuiltInRules/Rules`. If someone mentions a rule by its identifier that is in "snake_case" (e.g., `rule_name`), you can usually find the rule's implementation file named "UpperCamelCaseRule.swift" (e.g., `<RuleName>Rule.swift`) in one of the sub-folders depending on the rule's kind. Specific configurations for rules are located in the `RuleConfigurations` folder, which contains files named as `<RuleName>Configuration.swift` (e.g., `IdentifierNameConfiguration.swift`).

User-facing changes must be documented in the `CHANGELOG.md` file, which is organized by version. New entries always go into the "Main" section. They give credit to the person who has made the change and they reference the issue which has been fixed by the change.

All changes on configuration options must be reflected in `Tests/IntegrationTests/default_rule_configurations.yml`. This can be achieved by running `swift run swiftlint-dev rules register`. Running this command is also necessary when new rules got added or removed to (un-)register them from/in the list of built-in rules and tests verifying all examples in rule descriptions.

For some rules, there are dedicated tests in `Tests/BuiltInRulesTests`. However, they are typically not required as all the examples in the rule descriptions are automatically tested. The examples in the rule descriptions are also used to generate documentation for the rules. If an example presents a very pathological case, that's helpful for testing but not for user documentation, you can add the `excludeFromDocumentation: true` parameter to the example initializer. Important is that all examples in the rule description are verified by running `<RuleName>RuleGeneratedTests` for rule modified rules.

The functionality of configurations does not need to be tested explicitly either. But all options should be verified in the provided examples with the `configuration:` parameter as well.

All changes need to pass `swift test --parallel` as well as running SwiftLint on itself. The command `swift run swiftlint` run in the root directory of the project does that.
